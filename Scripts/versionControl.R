# how to link an existing project to github

# Open Git Bash or Terminal and navigate to the directory 
# containing your project files. 
# Move around directories by 

# type
# CD for change directory, followed by the path of the directory.

# When the command prompt in the line before $ says the correct location
# of your project, you are in the correct location. 

# type 
# git init 
# git add. (with .!) 

# This Initializes this directory as a Git repository 
# and Stages / adds all of the files in the directory to your local repository. 
# Commit these changes to the Git repository using 

# git commit -m "Initial Commit" 

# At this point, we have an R project linked to Git version control. 
# To link it to Github, 

# go to github.com

# Create a new repository with the same name
# note: do not initialize the readme, gitignore or license. 

# Once you've created this repository, 
# there is an option to push an existing repository from the command line 
# with instructions below containing code on how to do so.

# In Git Bash or Terminal, copy and paste these lines of code 
# After doing so, refresh your GitHub page 

# you should now have access to the Git tab in the upper right quadrant
# then you can push to GitHub from within RStudio any future changes.
